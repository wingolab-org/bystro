=head1 DESCRIPTION

  @class Seq::Tracks::Vcf::Build
  Takes a VCF file, runs it through a vcf pre-processor to get it into 
  our internal annotation format, and then uses the info field to build a database
  Will skip discordant sites, logging them
=cut

# TODO: better error handling in the vcf pre-processor
# TODO: Support fields delimited by something other than just , for Number=A
# TODO: Move opening of vcf to Seq::Input::Vcf
# TODO: Be more explicit with naming of indices from the intermediate annotation output
# (such as vcfAltIdx = 4, rather than using 4 itself)

# Note ALT field is required, if not found will be appended
